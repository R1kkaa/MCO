Fork the repository and do your own parts, we can merge them later.<br/>
for components: I used https://mui.com/material-ui/<br/>

To Run:<br/>
Prerequisites: Install Node.js / Have NPM installed on your pc.<br/>

Steps: <br/>
1: Open CMD on "mco" folder.<br/>
2: type "npm start" without quotation marks on cmd<br/>
3: a locally hosted server should run and open up on your browser.<br/>
4: for any errors just msg me and i'll reply ASAP.<br/>

For displaying components or whatever put them in index.css: <br/>
In the, const App <br/>
add whatever component u want to display after the header component. <br/>
Ideally, all of these should be components so we can reuse them, or show and hide them easily. <br/>
For interactivity, like doing the button functions I can probably do it. <br/>
