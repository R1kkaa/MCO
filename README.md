Fork the repository and do your own parts, we can merge them later.<br/>
for components: I used https://mui.com/material-ui/<br/>

For displaying components or whatever put them in index.css<br/>
const App = () => {<br/>
  return (<br/>
    <body><br/>
    <Header />
    "Remove everything here and insert components or whatever u want to display here" -> ideally place components here instead of html/css so we can reuse them as needed, and maybe 1 file per component, <br/>
                                                                                          so we don't have any merging conflicts/issues. What you can do is make 1 component per div that u have to display or<br/>
                                                                                          whatever as needed, for button interactivity or connecting the webpages, i can do it na, what's important is you guys <br/>
                                                                                          finish the components.<br/>
    </body><br/>
  );<br/>
};<br/>
